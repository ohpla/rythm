# rythm
A processing script to mimic a random paragraph of text with a group of pictures.

Put your pictures in /data folder with a white background so that they have the same height.
Use a guided pattern to play with ascenders and descenders and align your pictures as letters.
You can add a blank picture to mimic words-spacing.

Run the script with processing.

See your result images in .png in /rythm folder.

You can play with:
- the size of the final cannevas with: size( , );
- the pictures height: fontSize = ;

Enjoy! ;)
